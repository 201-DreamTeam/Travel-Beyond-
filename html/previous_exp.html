                        <h2>Meet turtles and sloths, Costa Rica</h2>
                        <p>
                            Tortuguero means place of turtles in Spanish, so head to Tortuguero NP on the north of the
                            Caribbean coast. Visit a beach at night and you might spot hawksbill (Mar-Nov), two-metre
                            leatherback (Mar-May), green sea turtles (Jul-Oct) and loggerhead (May-Aug). If you want to
                            see
                            olive ridley, visit Santa Rosa NP on the Pacific coast (Jul-Feb). Meanwhile, you can see
                            Hoffman’s two-toed sloth and brown-throated sloth on Osa Peninsula.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Make it happen: Fly to San José. Escape by bus from Gran Carib terminal downtown to Cariari,
                            then on to La Pavona. From there, you can go by boat to Tortuguero NP. To see sloths, join a
                            guided night hike, as they’re tricky to spot.

                        <p>
                            Alan Wood, one of our readers put it perfectly when he said, “Imagine our surprise when we
                            came
                            upon the family of gorillas all sleeping peacefully with only the silverback on watch. We
                            sat
                            enchanted at their feet and, after a while, they started to wake and stretch just like a
                            human
                            family in the morning. He was unperturbed by our presence and we felt privileged to be
                            visiting."

                            Make it happen: fly to Rwanda or Uganda. For Rwanda, fly to Kigali, and for Uganda, fly to
                            Entebbe, near Kampala. In both countries, gorilla-trekking permits start from US $500.

                            There’s no need to don your diving gear - just bring a mask and snorkel, immerse yourself in
                            the
                            shallow lagoon and wait for a graceful giant to glide silently by. While you're exploring

                            here host some of the most diverse marine life on earth.

                            airport take 45 minutes; some stop at the islands of Moorea, Huahine and Raiatea.

                            A fine force of nature straddling the border between Argentina and Brazil, this chasm is one
                            of
                            the widest waterfalls in the world, consisting of 275 cascades spread in a horseshoe shape
                            over
                            3km. Make the journey on foot and let your anticipation build with the growing roar before
                            emerging to soak up the spray on a walkway or boat ride.

                            the visitor centre; from here, walk or take a quick train ride to the falls.

                            The notorious sail to Antarctica across the Drake Passage can be a tough one, but that's
                            swiftly
                            forgotten as you start to see more and more ‘bergy bits’. Of course, the wildlife is a
                            reason to
                            go to Antarctica too: the various penguins steal your heart while sightings of whales,
                            leopard
                            seals and snowy shearwaters will make any trip memorable.

                        Deep in the Jordanian desert, hemmed in by sandstone crags and approached along a slither of a
                        canyon, suddenly an ancient facade looms out of the rock. And not a weathered outline: a
                        crisply-defined colossus, six mighty pillars guarding the entrance as if the Nabateans (who
                        built them two millennia ago) had just popped out for lunch.
                        <br>

                            Today, deep in the tangled interior of the Petén Basin, it feels like time has stood still:
                            climb the iconic Jaguar Temple and watch the sun set over the primordial jungle for an
                            ancient
                            overview. Just don’t leave your bag unattended: the local coatis, raccoon-type creatures,
                            have
                            light paws and a penchant for muesli bars.

                            The Flores-Tikal minibus ride takes around 75 minutes. Tikal is open 6am-6pm; stay overnight
                            so

                            that shape-shift with the wind. They’re not just big, they’re beautiful – gracefully curved,
                            rippled, and apricot-orange under a perennial blue sky.
