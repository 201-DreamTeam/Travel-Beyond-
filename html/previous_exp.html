                    <h2>1. Meet turtles and sloths, Costa Rica</h2>
                    <p>
                        Tortuguero means place of turtles in Spanish, so head to Tortuguero NP on the north of the
                        Caribbean coast. Visit a beach at night and you might spot hawksbill (Mar-Nov), two-metre
                        leatherback (Mar-May), green sea turtles (Jul-Oct) and loggerhead (May-Aug). If you want to see
                        olive ridley, visit Santa Rosa NP on the Pacific coast (Jul-Feb). Meanwhile, you can see
                        Hoffman’s two-toed sloth and brown-throated sloth on Osa Peninsula.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Make it happen: Fly to San José. Escape by bus from Gran Carib terminal downtown to Cariari,
                        then on to La Pavona. From there, you can go by boat to Tortuguero NP. To see sloths, join a
                        guided night hike, as they’re tricky to spot.

                    <h2>2. Meet mountain gorillas, Rwanda/Uganda</h2>
                    <p>
                        Alan Wood, one of our readers put it perfectly when he said, “Imagine our surprise when we came
                        upon the family of gorillas all sleeping peacefully with only the silverback on watch. We sat
                        enchanted at their feet and, after a while, they started to wake and stretch just like a human
                        family in the morning. He was unperturbed by our presence and we felt privileged to be
                        visiting."
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Make it happen: fly to Rwanda or Uganda. For Rwanda, fly to Kigali, and for Uganda, fly to
                        Entebbe, near Kampala. In both countries, gorilla-trekking permits start from US $500.

                    <h2>3. Snorkel in Bora Bora, French Polynesia</h2>
                    <p>
                        There’s no need to don your diving gear - just bring a mask and snorkel, immerse yourself in the
                        shallow lagoon and wait for a graceful giant to glide silently by. While you're exploring this
                        underwater garden, don’t be surprised if you bump into a bat, leopard or eagle ray – the waters
                        here host some of the most diverse marine life on earth.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Make it happen: Bora Bora is 250km north-west of Tahiti. Daily flights from Tahiti’s Faa’a
                        airport take 45 minutes; some stop at the islands of Moorea, Huahine and Raiatea.

                    <h2>4. Iguazu Falls, Argentina/Brazil</h2>
                    <p>
                        A fine force of nature straddling the border between Argentina and Brazil, this chasm is one of
                        the widest waterfalls in the world, consisting of 275 cascades spread in a horseshoe shape over
                        3km. Make the journey on foot and let your anticipation build with the growing roar before
                        emerging to soak up the spray on a walkway or boat ride.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Make it happen: Puerto Iguazú, Argentina, is a 90-minute flight from Buenos Aires. Buses run to
                        the visitor centre; from here, walk or take a quick train ride to the falls.

                    <h2>5. Appreciate all that ice, Antarctica</h2>
                    <p>
                        The notorious sail to Antarctica across the Drake Passage can be a tough one, but that's swiftly
                        forgotten as you start to see more and more ‘bergy bits’. Of course, the wildlife is a reason to
                        go to Antarctica too: the various penguins steal your heart while sightings of whales, leopard
                        seals and snowy shearwaters will make any trip memorable.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Make it happen: Expedition cruises leave from Ushuaia (Argentina), Christchurch (NZ) and Hobart
                        (Tasmania).

                    <h2>6. Get a glimpse of ancient Petra, Jordan</h2>
                    <p>
                        Deep in the Jordanian desert, hemmed in by sandstone crags and approached along a slither of a
                        canyon, suddenly an ancient facade looms out of the rock. And not a weathered outline: a
                        crisply-defined colossus, six mighty pillars guarding the entrance as if the Nabateans (who
                        built them two millennia ago) had just popped out for lunch.
                        <br>
                        Make it happen: Allow two days (or more). See our Petra travel guide for more information.

                        These coral-fringed islands offer lush forest scenery, unspoiled white beaches and plentiful
                        opportunities for scuba diving in their pristine turquoise waters. Get hands-on with turtle
                        conservation projects or stretch your legs on a trek through inland jungle brimming with
                        wildlife (including exotic birds, monkeys and giant monitor lizards).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Make it happen: The Perhentian Islands can be accessed by boat from Kuala Besut, 110km north of
                        Kuala Terengganu. Ferries to Tioman run from Mersing.

                    <p>
                        Today, deep in the tangled interior of the Petén Basin, it feels like time has stood still:
                        climb the iconic Jaguar Temple and watch the sun set over the primordial jungle for an ancient
                        overview. Just don’t leave your bag unattended: the local coatis, raccoon-type creatures, have
                        light paws and a penchant for muesli bars.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Make it happen: Flores is the gateway town for Tikal, serviced by flights from Guatemala City.
                        The Flores-Tikal minibus ride takes around 75 minutes. Tikal is open 6am-6pm; stay overnight so
                        you can catch sunset and sunrise at the site.

                    <h2>8. Delve into the dunes of Sossusvlei, Namibia</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are sand dunes, and there are sand dunes. And the Namib Desert’s offerings in this arena
                        are the Himalaya of the granular world: the dunes here tower up to 300m, massive undulations
                        that shape-shift with the wind. They’re not just big, they’re beautiful – gracefully curved,
                        rippled, and apricot-orange under a perennial blue sky.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Make it happen: Sossusvlei is 590km west of Windhoek. It’s accessible by 2WD; a 4WD is necessary
                        for the final 5km to Sossusvlei Pan (or walk from the car park).
