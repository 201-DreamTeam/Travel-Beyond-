            <h2>Why Travel?</h2>

            <p>Traveling is a very crucial part of life as it is the best way to get out of the busy schedule. It is
                also to experience life in different ways .<!-- Traveling is actually a good remedy for stress, anxiety and
                depression. It also improves mental and physical health. We only have one life and we should thank it
                for making us a more advanced creature on this planet. Not only do we get to experience the beauty of
                nature, different geographies ,topographies, and people.
                Traveling is all about exploring new places, cultures, cuisines, rituals and styles of living. We also
                travel because distance and difference are the secret toxicity of learning and creativity which one
                cannot observe by sitting at home. Traveling in itself has advantages, as it makes one forget his or her
                worries, problems, frustrations and fears. This helps by broadening your horizon to move in new
                directions, unplugging from the pulls and pushes of daily life. We have a passport to fill full of
                stamps rather than to have a house full of stuff. Letâ€™s use this to make memories all over the world. -->
